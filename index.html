      <h2>How this Old School RuneScape experience calculator works</h2>
      <p>
        Old School RuneScape uses a fixed XP curve from level 1 to level 99. This calculator reproduces
        that curve and instantly computes the <strong>total XP</strong> required for any level range.
        For each skill, the page stores a rough <strong>XP per hour</strong> and an average
        <strong>XP per action/kill</strong> based on popular mid-game training methods (things like
        <em>Sand Crabs</em>, <em>Ammonite Crabs</em>, rooftop Agility courses, high-level Fletching,
        and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
        When you hit “Calculate”, the tool:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Computes XP needed from your current level to your target level.</li>
        <li>Divides that by a typical XP/hr rate for your chosen skill to estimate hours.</li>
        <li>Uses an average XP per action to estimate how many kills, laps, logs, or items you'll do.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are <strong>rough estimates</strong> meant to help you plan your grind, not exact
        values. Efficient setups, tick manipulation, alt accounts, or slower AFK methods will all change
        your real numbers in game.
      </p>

      <h2>Maximizing XP / hour in Old School RuneScape</h2>
      <p>
        If you're trying to squeeze the most experience per hour out of your account, focus on three
        things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Gear &amp; unlocks</strong> – Better weapons, prayers, and quest unlocks (like
          <em>Neitiznot</em>, <em>Fighter torso</em>, <em>Barrows gloves</em>) dramatically speed up
          combat XP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location</strong> – Places like <em>Sand Crabs</em>, <em>Ammonite Crabs</em>,
          <em>Nightmare Zone</em>, rooftop Agility courses, or high-tier skilling spots give much more
          XP/hr than low level training areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AFK vs. sweaty</strong> – Semi-AFK methods are chill but slower. High-intensity
          click-heavy methods can double or triple XP/hr in some skills, especially <em>Agility</em>,
          <em>Thieving</em>, <em>Construction</em>, and <em>Herblore</em>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Use the numbers on this calculator to get a baseline, then dive into the linked guides for
        skill-specific meta strategies.

      <h2>OSRS XP Calculator FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Is this better than the in-game XP tracker?</h3>
      <p>
        The in-game XP tracker shows what you already did; this calculator shows what it will <em>take</em>
        to reach your goal. Plug in your target level and you'll see a realistic estimate of the grind
        in hours and actions.
      </p>

      <h3>Does this work for free-to-play players?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, but the XP/hr assumptions are usually based on popular members methods. If you're F2P,
        expect fewer XP/hr; you can mentally adjust the result or use slower XP rates from F2P training
        guides.
      </p>

      <h3>What if my XP / hour is much higher or lower?</h3>
      <p>
        That's totally normal. XP rates in Old School RuneScape vary a lot based on level, gear,
        quests, and how sweaty you play. Treat these numbers as a conservative estimate, then track your
        real XP/hr in game and compare.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use this as a general RuneScape skill calculator?</h3>
      <p>
        This tool is designed around the Old School RuneScape XP curve and skill list. The XP curve in
        RS3 is different, but for classic OSRS this page is a simple all-in-one skill calculator and
        experience planner.
